{{ prompt }}

To determine the source of the sensitive political statement, follow these steps:
1. Identify any indicators within the statement that suggest who might have said it. Look for verbs like "认为" (believe), "表达" (express), or specific references to individuals or positions.
2. If there are clear indicators, state who said the statement and provide the reason based on the language cues within the statement.
3. If the statement lacks clear indicators or attribution, state "unknown." Notice that some statements may involving some people, but the statement does not provide enough information to determine who said it. In this case, you should also state "unknown." Like "梁特首攻击自由党，寻找替罪者，表明特区政治的斗争性。" In this case, you should also state "unknown."

Format example: reason ## name or unknown
